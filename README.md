## 7 Card Poker Evaluator
7 card poker evaluator refers to 5 community cards and 2 players cards. The program will determine the best 5 card combination and will display the strength of the hand. Additionally, you can choose from 1 to 23 players to deal cards to and the program will determine the winner or the players that tied. (23 players max since each player gets 2 distinct cards and there are 5 community cards. So, 5 cards and 23 players uses 51 cards of the 52 card deck)

## 5 Card Poker Evaluator
5 card poker evaluator refers to 5 distinct cards in a player hand. The program will determine the strength of each hand, and you will be able to deal cards to a maximum of 10 players. The hands will then be compared, and a winner or a tie will be determined. (10 players max since each player gets 5 distinct cards which uses 50 cards of the 52 card deck)

## Speed Dealing
This program has a 'speed dealing' option that will allow the user to input the amount of games and the amount of players per games to run non-stop. This works for the 5 card and 7 card evaluator, and you can choose the amount of games you want to have console output for. However, keep in mind that printing output to the console significantly decreases the speed at which the program evaluates cards since it has a lot of overhead.

## Statistics
This program has a statistics feature that will calculate the experimental probability of getting a certain hand strength. This can be used in combination with the speed dealing option, which will demonstrate the accuracy of the experimental probabilities generated by the program compared to the actual mathematical probabilities.
